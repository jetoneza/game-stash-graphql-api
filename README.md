# game-stash-graphql-api
A simple graphql API for my GameStash app.

Run the database migration:
```bash
$npm run db migrate:latest
```

Run seed to populate database with sample data:
```bash
$npm run db seed:run
```

Run app:
```bash
$npm run dev
```

Go to localhost:3333/graphiql to play with the graphql API.
